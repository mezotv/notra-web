## What is Notra?

Content Engine might be a bit wrong its more of a content turbo. Just like a car's turbo recycles exhaust gases into more power, Notra takes the data you're already generating such as merged GitHub PRs, completed Linear issues, Slack conversations, commits, and team activity and turns it into blog posts, changelogs, tweets, LinkedIn posts, or even investor updates.

It's designed to work in the background so you wake up with a feed of content drafts. All in the autonomous.

## Why is Notra?

I was in San Francisco sleeping in an old office in [Konstantin Wohlwend's](https://x.com/konstiwohlwend) hacker house, I was building a CMS at the time, so naturally, we talked about content and writing a lot. We also played around with [Contentport](https://www.contentport.io/), and naturally, since we all post a lot of content, we asked Konstantin why he doesn’t as much. He mentioned not having enough time and wished someone would just analyze the work he does throughout the day and give him ideas for what to post!

Notra takes this further and gives you drafts that you could just publish (you probably shouldn't though).

## Key Features

### Automatic Data Collection
Connect your existing tools like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Linear](https://linear.app), [Slack](https://slack.com), and more. Notra collects the data your team generates every single day either through webhooks or native integrations.

### Intelligent Content Generation
The content engine is an agent that analyzes your raw data and generates multiple content formats: blog posts, changelogs, social media updates, and investor updates. All customized to fit your voice and audience.

### Fully Autonomous
Go to sleep after a long day of work and wake up to a bunch of content drafts waiting to be iterated on or published directly. Notra works for you in the background!
