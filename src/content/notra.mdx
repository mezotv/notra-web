# Notra

**Notra** is a content engine that transforms the operational data your company generates anyways into content drafts you can iterate on faster!

## What is Notra?

Content Engine might be a bit wrong its more of a content turbo. Just like a car's turbo recycles exhaust gases into more power, Notra takes the data you're already generating such as merged GitHub PRs, completed Linear issues, Slack conversations, commits, and team activity and turns it into blog posts, changelogs, tweets, LinkedIn posts, or even investor updates.

It's designed to work in the background so you wake up with a feed of content drafts. All in the autonomous.

## Key Features

### Automatic Data Collection
Connect your existing tools like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Linear](https://linear.app), [Slack](https://slack.com), and more. Notra collects the operational data your team generates every single day.

### Intelligent Content Generation
Our content engine analyzes your raw data and generates multiple content formats: blog posts, changelogs, social media updates, and investor-ready summaries. All customized to fit your voice and audience.

### Multi-Format Publishing
One data point becomes multiple pieces of content. A shipped feature generates a changelog entry, a tweet, a [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) post, and talking points for stakeholders.

### Inspiration On Demand
Wake up to a curated feed of content ideas and drafts ready for review. No more scrambling for update ideas - your work writes itself.
