# Notra

**Notra** is a Content Turbo engine that transforms the operational data your company generates into ready-to-share content.

## What is Notra?

Just like a car's turbo engine recycles exhaust gases into more power, Notra takes the data you're already generating—merged GitHub PRs, completed Linear issues, Slack conversations, commits, and team activity—and transforms it into compelling blog posts, changelogs, tweets, LinkedIn posts, and investor updates.

You wake up with a feed of ready-to-post content. All in the background.

## Key Features

### Automatic Data Collection
Connect your existing tools—GitHub, Linear, Slack, and more. Notra seamlessly ingests the operational data your team generates every single day.

### Intelligent Content Generation
Our content engine analyzes your raw data and generates multiple content formats: blog posts, changelogs, social media updates, and investor-ready summaries. All tailored to your voice.

### Multi-Format Publishing
One data point becomes multiple pieces of content. A shipped feature generates a changelog entry, a tweet, a LinkedIn post, and talking points for stakeholders.

### Inspiration On Demand
Wake up to a curated feed of content ideas and drafts ready for review. No more scrambling for update ideas—your work writes itself.
